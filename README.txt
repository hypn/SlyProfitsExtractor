Hypn's SlyProfits Extractor 1.5

This program reads in a text file of data copied from SlyProfits (a World of Warcraft Addon) and turns that data into a ".csv" which can be opened in Excel etc. I wrote this to help me keep track of which items are profitable and to see how the profit changes day by day. 

You can download SlyProfits from: http://wow.curse.com/downloads/wow-addons/details/slyprofits.aspx
You will also need the "CopyThat!" addon - you can download it from: http://wow.curse.com/downloads/wow-addons/details/project-4497.aspx

Instructions:
1. Do a scan in SlyProfits
2. With the scan results open (I generally sort the results by profit), type this into the chat: "/cpyt AuctionFrameFlask"
3. Copy everything in the window that opens to a text file
4. Scroll down (in SlyProfits) so the next screen of scan results are shown
5. Repeat steps 2-4 until you reach the end of the scan results (pasting into the same text file each time)
6. Save the text file
7. Run "Hypn's SlyProfits Extrator.exe" and select the text file you saved
8. Open the "SlyProfits.csv" file created (in the directory of "Hypn's SlyProfits Extrator.exe") in Excel
